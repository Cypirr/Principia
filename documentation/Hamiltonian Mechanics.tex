In this post I shall assume understanding of the concepts described in
chapter~4 (Conservation of Energy), chapter~8 (Motion) as well as sections
11--4 and 11--5 (Vectors and Vector algebra) of chapter~11 of Richard
Feynmann's \emph{Lectures on Physics}.

It is the continuation of my \emph{Introduction to Runge-Kutta Integrators},
but it does not rely on the concepts described in that post.

\section{Motivation}
We have previously seen how to compute the evolution of physical systems while
keeping the buildup of error in check. However, the error will still build up
over time. We would like to ensure that fundamental properties of the physical
system are preserved. For instance, we'd like a low strongly-bound orbit not to
turn into an escape trajectory (or a reentry) over time: we need conservation
of energy.

In order to make an integrator that conserves energy, it is helpful to look at
physics from a viewpoint where the conservation of energy is the fundamental
hypothesis, rather than a consequence of the application of some forces.

\section{Gravitation from a Hamiltonian viewpoint}
We consider a system of $N$ bodies $1$ through $N$, with masses $m_1$ through
$m_j$. The state of the system is defined by the \emph{positions} and
\emph{momenta} of those bodies. For each body $j$, the position $\vQ_j$ and the
momentum $\vP_j$ are 3-dimensional vectors, so the state of the entire system
lies in a $6N$-dimensional space, the \emph{classical\footnote{A similar
formalism exists for quantum mechanics, in which case we talk about the
\emph{quantum} phase space.} phase space}.
We can write the state as $\tuple{\vq, \vp}$, where $\vq = \tuple{q_1, \dotsc,
q_{3N}}$ and $\vp =  \tuple{p_1, \dotsc, p_{3N}}$ are $3N$-dimensional.

The total energy $\Hamiltonian$, the \emph{Hamiltonian} is a function
of the state of the system, the energy of a given state being $\Hamiltonian(\vq,
\vp)$.

The evolution of the state $\tuple{\vq, \vp}$ is given for each component $i\in
\set{1,\dotsc,3N}$, by the \emph{equations of motion}
\[
\begin{cases}
\deriv t {q_i} &= \deriv {p_i} \Hamiltonian \\
\deriv t {p_i} &= -\deriv {q_i} \Hamiltonian
\end{cases}.
\]
This is can be written\footnote{Readers familiar with multivariate calculus
might prefer the notations $\deriv t {\vq} = \grad_{\vp} \Hamiltonian,
\deriv t {\vp} = -\grad_{\vq} \Hamiltonian$, or $\derivop t 
\begin{pmatrix}
\vq \\
\vp
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\nullmat    & \Identity \\
-\Identity & \nullmat
\end{pmatrix}
\grad \Hamiltonian$.}
as
\[
\begin{cases}
\deriv t {\vq} &= \deriv {\vp} \Hamiltonian \\
\deriv t {\vp} &= -\deriv {\vq} \Hamiltonian
\end{cases}.
\]
In this way, we have \emph{defined} the change in position and momentum as a
function of time, and thus completely desccribed how the system will evolve from
an initial state $\tuple{\vq_0, \vp_0}$.

From this formulation it immediately follows that energy is conserved:
indeed,
\begin{align*}
\deriv t \Hamiltonian &= \scal{\deriv \vq \Hamiltonian}{\deriv t \vq}
    + \scal{\deriv \vp \Hamiltonian}{\deriv t \vp} \\
&= \scal{\deriv \vq \Hamiltonian}{\deriv \vp \Hamiltonian}
    - \scal{\deriv \vp \Hamiltonian}{\deriv \vq \Hamiltonian} = 0.
\end{align*}

Here the energy is $\Hamiltonian = T + V$, where $T$ is the kinetic energy
and $V$ is the gravitational potential energy.
Since $T$ only depends on the momenta $\vp$ (recall that for body $j$,
$T_j = \frac{1}{2} m_j v_j^2$ and $\vP_j = m_j\vv_j$) and $V$ only depends
on the positions $\vq$, we get:
\[
\Hamiltonian\of{\vp, \vq} = T\of{\vp} + V\of{\vq}
\]
so the equations of motion become
\[
\begin{cases}
\deriv t {\vq} &= \deriv {\vp} T \\
\deriv t {\vp} &= -\deriv {\vq} V
\end{cases}.
\]
For a single body $j$, this gives us
\[
\begin{cases}
\deriv t {\vQ_j} &= \deriv {\vP_j} T = \derivop {\vP_j}\frac{1}{2} m_j v_j^2
    = v \\
\deriv t {\vP_j} &= -\deriv {\vq} V
\end{cases}.
\]

In other words, the change in position is the velocity, and the change in
momentum (the force) is in the direction which decreases the potential.
It helps to visualise the potential for a two-dimensional problem, where the
position of a body $j$ is given by $x_j$ and $y_j$. One can plot the potential
$V\of{x_j, y_j}$ as a hilly landscape, where wells are created by the other
bodies. The force on $j$ (the change in its momentum) is then directed downhill,
its magnitude proportional to the slope of the hill, as if $j$ were a ball
rolling atop those hills.
See for instance the potential created by Pluto and Charon in the margin.
A one-dimensional example can be seen at \url{https://xkcd.com/681_large/}.

From this formulation of the equation of motions, it is possible to deduce
properties of the trajectories just from the initial energy, even when the
trajectories are very convoluted. Indeed, since the energy is conserved and
since the kinetic energy (equal to $\frac12 m_j v_j^2$ for each body $j$)
is never negative (at worst it is $0$ for an unmoving body), the system
cannot reach a position $\vq$ where the potential $V\of\vq$ is greater than the
initial energy.

Again, this is best seen on a 2-dimensional example with a single body moving
in a fixed potential. If we plot the landscape of the potential, and a waterline
at the level of the initial energy, we know that the body cannot be found on dry
land at any time, no matter how complicated its trajectory is; if the trajectory
converts the whole of the body's kinetic energy into potential energy, it will
only reach the shore.

Moreover, the body cannot\footnote{In quantum mechanics this happens: this is
quantum tunnelling.} ``jump'' over dry land, as that would require going through
areas of potential higher than the total energy. It is confined to the ``lake''
in which it started.

The plots below show various regions allowed by the total energy in the
previously shown potential, together with example trajectories at these
energies. Note that the trajectories are computed assuming the potential is
constant (which is not true in the case of Pluto and Charon, since these bodies
revolve around each other). We'll look at a more realistic situation in a later
post.

\section{Conclusion}
We see that the nature of the possible trajectories changes fundamentally when
the energy changes, from strongly-bound orbits to transfers to outright escapes.
It would therefore be useful to be able to guarantee that energy does not drift
too much even over long periods of time when numerically computing these
trajectories. Surprisingly, while guaranteeing that the actual position does not
drift away from the truthis impossible, it \emph{is} possible to ensure that the
\emph{energy} does not drift, thus ensuring that the essential nature of the
trajectory remains unchanged.

Integrators which enforce conservation of energy are called \emph{symplectic}
integrators.
