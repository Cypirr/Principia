\maketitle
In this post I shall assume understanding of the concepts described in
chapter~8 (Motion) as well as sections 11--4 and 11--5 (Vectors and Vector
algebra) of chapter~11 of Richard Feynmann's \emph{Lectures on Physics}.

It is the continuation of my \emph{Introduction to Runge-Kutta Integrators},
but it does not rely on the concepts described in that post.
